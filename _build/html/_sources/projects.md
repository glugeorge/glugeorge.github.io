# Coding Projects

This section keeps track of some of the projects that I've worked on that showcase various applications of coding/data science to earth science topics. 

## 2022
### Hurricanes tracks and their economic impacts in a changing climate:  
- Project for a [Climate Prediction Challenges](https://leap.columbia.edu/) course
- Group project found [here](https://github.com/katelmarsh/hurricanes_climate_pred)
- This project used hierarchical clustering to identify two different "classes" of hurricanes that pose a financially damaging risk. It then investigates the evolution of these hurricanes with respect to a changing climate.
- I specifically conducted all the data cleaning/processing and initial k-means clustering for analyzing "financially damaging" hurricanes and how they may evolve with climate change. I also created most of the data visualizations. 

### A physics guided machine learning model for lake temperature prediction:
- Project for a [Climate Prediction Challenges](https://leap.columbia.edu/) course
- Project found [here](https://github.com/glugeorge/random-analysis-projects/tree/main/Physics%20Guided%20Machine%20Learning%20for%20a%20Lake%20Stratification%20Model)
- This project had us fine-tuning an existing process-guided LSTM model that predicts lake temperature profiles
- Our team attuned this model to use a dynamic learning rate with an SGD optimizer
- I specifically further attuned this model by recognizing that basal depth temperatures of the lake do not vary much, so I trained it on only the top 60% of depths, which still produced similarly accurate predictions for the entire depth profile.

## 2021
### A correlation analysis of meltwater runoff and glacier velocities on the Greenland Ice Sheet
- My final project for a [Research Computing in Earth Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html) course
- Project found [here](https://github.com/glugeorge/rces-project)
- This project involved displaying spatial averages of runoff and velocity over time to compare trends across the entire GIS, while also having 2d heatmaps of the cross correlation to see if only specific regions are strongly influenced by runoff
