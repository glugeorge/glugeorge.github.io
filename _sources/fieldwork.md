# Fieldwork

I have a seperate page describing fieldwork so I can include some pictures from each season. 

## Greenland, May 2022
Over 3 weeks in May, I joined Professors Meredith Nettles and Laura Stevens on helicopter day trips from Ilulissat, Greenland to the ablation zone of the nearby ice sheet to deploy GPS and ApRES systems around a set of supraglacial lakes. This was my first field project ever! (photos to be added shortly)
