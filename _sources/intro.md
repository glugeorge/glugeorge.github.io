# Welcome

## Hi, I'm George! 
I am a budding geophysics/glaciology PhD student at the [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University](https://lamont.columbia.edu/).  I have a background in both engineering (BASc in [Engineering Science from the University of Toronto](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/)) and physics (Physics specialization in Engineering Science).

I am mainly focused on revealing how our ice sheets react to an ever-changing climate. My current research involves modelling the physics of subglacial hydrology, in addition to using radar techniques to study supraglacial lake drainages. My current supervisor is [Jonathan Kingslake](http://www.jkingslake.com/). 

My past work has broadly covered the intersection between physics, engineering, and earth sciences. My quest to better understand our planet has used tools ranging from idealized fluid dynamics experiments in a lab to supercomputer-generated global climate model simulations. 

I'm always excited to explore the broader interdisciplinary impacts of rather specific scientific processes. Consequently, I'm eager to chat and learn about about climate and its intersections with data science, policy, and many other fields. Currently, I'm quite interested in exploring machine learning in earth science, in addition to natural language processing and the science-policy or science-industry interface.
