# Welcome

## Hi, I'm George! 
I'm a PhD candidate at [Columbia University](https://lamont.columbia.edu/) studying Polar Geophysics. My advisor is [Prof. Jonathan Kingslake](http://www.jkingslake.com/). I use mathematical, geophysical, and machine learning tools to examine and model ice sheets, a critical component of the climate system whose loss will dramatically impact the environment, the economy, and many vulnerable communities. I have a background in both engineering (BASc in [Engineering Science from the University of Toronto](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/)) and physics (Physics specialization in Engineering Science). 

I'm always excited to explore the broader interdisciplinary impacts of rather specific scientific processes. I'm eager to chat and learn about about climate and its intersections with data science, policy, and many other fields. Currently, I'm quite interested in exploring machine learning in earth science, in addition to ESG/sustainability efforts in industry. 

As of September 2025, I am on the lookout for interesting roles post-PhD. I hope to apply my geophysics knowledge along with my data science tools to either deepening our foundational knowledge of our planet, and/or bettering it for the future.
