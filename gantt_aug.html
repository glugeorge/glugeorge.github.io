  <h1>A schedule/checklist of to-dos before August 2022 departure for Greenland</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this Gantt chart below is to set a rough timeline for the checklist items to be completed.
    Hovering over each bar will show the people that the steps are specific to (Under "Resource" - this is a Google Dev default I could not change right away).
    Laura, being offline at the time of development, is free to help at any of these steps when available, 
    though I would generally group Laura and Meredith together, especially for the review and knowledge transfer steps.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the in-lab stuff, it is assumed that I (George) would do it if present. Otherwise I currently list Meredith, Elizabeth, or Jonny (just whoever is available) as 
    the people for those tasks. They're generally all pretty quick tasks, and I will continue to think about if anything else is 
    needed in lab. When those tasks are completed (pre-George NYC arrival), let me know to note it down.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Gantt Chart</h2>
  <div id="chart_div"></div>

  <h2>Details for each step</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Finish addressing comments</dt>
    <dd>- Go through Laura's, Meredith's, and Jonny's feedback and incorporate into existing review/plan</dd>
    <dt>Count SD Cards in lab</dt>
    <dd>- Make sure that we have the correct number of cards to bring (I currently have 6 listed, though maybe 2 additional backups would be good). 
      There's also 4 unused in Ilulissat</dd>
    <dd>- If there aren't enough cards, let George know so he can update the materials list to purchase some.</dd>
    <dt>Set aside SMA connectors from built antenna boxes for packing</dt>
    <dd>- A quick check to just disassemble the built antenna boxes and extract the SMA cables and make sure that they are accounted for/labelled to pack for Ilulissat.</dd>
    <dt>Finalize equipment chart</dt>
    <dd>- Considering the comments given, update the materials spreadsheet</dd>
    <dd>- This spreadsheet will be the basis of any purchases</dd>
    <dt>Finalize drafting test scripts + instructions for use</dt>
    <dd>- I will let Jonny know when this is done, and provide the instructions to get this onto the toughbook and run with test data</dd>
    <dt>Review equipment chart</dt>
    <dd>- I am hoping that in some point during this window, we can go over my finalized chart and agree on what needs to be purchased</dd>
    <dt>Draft new triaged plan</dt>
    <dd>- This is using the comments from the old review/plan</dd>
    <dd>- The purpose of this new plan is to provide step by step instructions in Greenland</dd>
    <dd>- It will also order points to address by importance/how critical it is for success</dd>
    <dd>- It will describe what issues to look out for, and what to do if those issues are identified</dd>
    <dd>- It will also describe materials needed for the solutions, and detail what can be done in-field vs before the trip in-town</dd>
    <dt>Get scripts onto toughbook and run</dt>
    <dd>- George will need to provide instructions on libraries needed/environment set up</dd>
    <dd>- George will also provide the code itself in the form of a Github repository</dd>
    <dt>Format SD cards and set aside for packing</dt>
    <dd>- Label these to be packed for Ilulissat (on their case)</dd>
    <dd>- To format, you just need a computer and an SD card reader. 
      <a href="https://www.grdian.com/resources/how-to-format-exfat-to-fat32">These steps here</a> then give the exact procedure.</dd>
    <dt>Purchase materials</dt>
    <dd>- Once materials have been finalized, George can send purchasing requests to Kaylee or whoever necessary. </dd>
    <dd>- George will also keep track of orders and let people know when they've arrived (in the case where he is not already in the lab).</dd>
    <dt>Review new triaged plan</dt>
    <dd>- A similar comment iteration, except this time with hopefully a more detailed/cohesive document that mimics the intended flow of work in the field</dd>
    <dt>Recieve and sort materials</dt>
    <dd>- As packages arrive, unpack them and stage them for packing. Note in the materials document once they've arrived</dd>
    <dt>Pack materials to bring</dt>
    <dd>- We pack everything and note down what has been packed. Ensure weights are ok.</dd>
    <dt>Review scripts/knowledge transfer to team</dt>
    <dd>- After scripts have been tested, this step consists of educating the field team how to run them and how to interpret results.</dd>
    <dt>Finalize triaged plan</dt>
    <dd>- This will be to review the new triaged plan and make sure that every member knows their role.</dd>
    <dd>- The goal is that after this review, the team is clear about what needs to be done upon arrival in Ilulissat</dd>
